# Progressive Web application
The following project is a progressive web application for the use of inducting new students into the university. This will be done using a list of steps that can be defined by the lecturer in JSON format.
## Setting a New Route
A route can be set using JavaScript Object Notation in the pets.json file. The example contained within is for teaching simple computer use. The parameters are as follows:
* name: The name of the activity
* location: where the activity is located
* category: the category that the activity falls under
* description: a brief description of the activity or a list of steps to accomplish the activity
* filename: a .jpg image of the location or a .jpg slide with detailed instructions

An example JSON snippet is below to be filled in:
```JSON
{
  "route_name":
  [
    {"name": "", "location": "", "category": "", "description": "", "filename": ""},
    {"name": "", "location": "", "category": "", "description": "", "filename": ""}
  ]
}
```
